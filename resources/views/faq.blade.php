                        <p>You will need an ERC20 wallet to store your BCT tokens. We recommend to use the MyEtherWallet as it is the easiest way and does most of the work for you.</p>

                            <h3 class="text-left">12. When will the reward payouts begin and how will they work?</h3>
                        </div>
                        <p>The rewards distribution will begin shortly after the ICO have been completed and the rewards will ramp up in volume as the first miners come online (Refer to our White paper for more details). The rewards will be paid out in ETH into nominated ETH wallet to which the user holds BaltiCrypto tokens. At the time of a monthly rewards distribution, if the token(s) are held in a public exchange wallet you will not be able to receive your rewards in that month. Its important that you hold your tokens in the private wallet whenever possible. (Unless our partner exchanges stipulate they will pass the rewards onto you). NB: * BaltiCrypto's smart contract knows the location of all current BaltiCrypto token holders by storing a list of all token holding addresses on the blockchain. - Each reward is sent the tokens exact address location at the time or reward distribution.<br>For BCT tokens listed to public exchanges, our executive team will make every endeavour to cooperate with the exchanges in order to send rewards to BCT token holders, directly into the exchange wallet. This will need to be done on a case by case basis with each exchange, but we have full confidence in our team.</p>

                        </div>
                        <p>Secondary markets are not controlled by BaltiCrypto. We expect the trading price to rise steadily, but dividend payments for token holders are tied to the real value of mining profits and will not be affected by positive or negative trading price fluctuations.</p>
