                        <p>Renewable energy is a one of the core elements of BaltiCrypto’s Ecoverse which contributes to the project being the most energy efficient, cost effective and sustainable as it can, while creating a positive impact on our planet as well as rapidly reducing carbon footprint.</p>
                        <p>Our plan is to expand production at our renewable energy parks (solar and wind power sources), as well as sourcing and developing newer and better technologies to maintain 100% green energy use as our scope and reach expand. Our aim is not only to make our Ecoverse 100% green but also participate in various renewable energy projects in Estonia and globally.</p>
                        <p> BaltiCrypto encompasses the SMART Hybrid Renewable Energy Solution, using wind and solar power, backed by state-of-the-art battery storage, fulfilling the energy requirements for our Ecoverse projects...<span class="read-more"> Read more</span></p>

                        <p>Further down the track, rather than only using renewable-energy plants, we are planning to use waste-to-energy technologies. As the amount of waste produced grows, we need to find ways to find worthwhile uses for it, which in turn reduce the amount which finds its way into the environment.  It’s an obvious triple win, solving the waste, energy, and climate crises in one package.</p>
                        <p>It’s therefore imperative that we use all possible renewable energy technologies to supply the consumption needs of the growing blockchain ecosystem.                        </p>
