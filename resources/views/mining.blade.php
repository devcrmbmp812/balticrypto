                            <p class="mining-more1">BaltiCrypto’s aim is to create the most energy efficient, sustainable, environmentally friendly and SMART cryptocurrency mining farm in the world, using 100% renewable energy for mining operations. We see this goal as eminently achievable through ingenuity, innovation, first adoption of new technologies and creation of industry-leading software solutions, and intelligent production and use of renewable energy.
                            It is our goal to stay ahead of the competition and constantly develop new sustainable ways of mining and increase efficiency. The crypto mining space is only going to become more competitive, and increasingly compartmentalised. Being at capacity as soon as possible, and reinvesting mining rewards to build additional infrastructure, will position BaltiCrypto for success in both the short and long term.
                            Given the present rates of global warming, and the urgent need for solution, as well as the difficulty transitioning to clean energy, we do not have the luxury of deferring energy consumption questions to a later date.  We will commence with 100% renewable energy supply, and stay that way, always...<span class="color-font">Read more</span> </p>

                            <p>This reduced energy demand of course also fulfils our goal of being environmentally responsible, and increases our ability to rely on 100% renewable energy to power the farm. Heat generated by the system is directly and efficiently transferred to the cooling fluid, thereby eliminating the need for noisy and expensive fans and other cooling equipment.  These improvements increase energy efficiency and enable higher packaging densities. Using high-efficiency heat exchange technology, the heat removed from the boards will be used to heat boilers, which will heat maintenance offices on site, and eventually the BaltiCrypto SMART Future Village, which will be just another way BaltiCrypto will set the standard for sustainability and intelligent commerce.</p>

                                Thanks to our fully automated system we can detect and located defective racks which may lose electricity, networking or other functionality within a very limited amount of time. GPUs are connected with LEDs that translate software-based issue detection into different light signals, allowing maintenance workers gain the ability to quickly and reliably detect and replace defective hardware. Facilities will be actively monitored 24/7/365 by our expert technicians.

                                As previously mentioned, electricity is the lifeblood of a mining operation. Mining rigs rely on a constant source of reliable energy, both to operate the rig, as well as to power the cooling systems required.  For this reason, the success and profitability of any mining venture will be largely determined by the availability and affordability of the prevailing power supply.

                                The importance of this in placing BaltiCrypto above the competition for profitability, cannot be overstated.

                                    In order to keep the facility at the highest level of profitability we constantly monitor the market for new technologies, and will update the hardware on a regular basis (approx. every 1.5 years for GPU’s); however, this will only be done where the rewards generated by new hardware is greater.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Thanks to our fully automated system we can detect and located defective racks which may lose electricity, networking or other functionality within a very limited amount of time. GPUs are connected with LEDs that translate software-based issue detection into different light signals, allowing maintenance workers gain the ability to quickly and reliably detect and replace defective hardware. Facilities will be actively monitored 24/7/365 by our expert technicians.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    As up to 40% (depending on the year) of mining rewards are being reinvested into the operation we will generate enough capital to constantly renew outdated hardware. The cost for upgrades will be lower than initial costs, as only core parts need upgrade and we will recoup some costs through the sale of used parts.

                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    As mining activity expands, we will continually assess new technologies that are able to better process different types of algorithms. At this stage GPU’s provide the best lifespan and are the most readily available. Should better hardware become available which increase mining efficiency, without compromising longevity and resale potential, we will of course incorporate these into our operations.
                                 </p>
                                <h2 class="title-2 text-center">Custom built Software (SmartWare)</h2>
                                <p>
                                    We use Scrypt as our proof-of-work algorithm, ensuring that our equipment provides the fastest payoﬀ. Our SMART Mining concept is based on unique software (SmartWare) that allows us to scan the entire crypto mining market for the most profitable coins at any given time and to adjust our equipment to it. Factors which the software will rely on are current coin price/exchange rate, difficulty factor, hash algorithm and the hardware we are using at the time.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    After the plant has mined various Altcoins or even Bitcoins, they flow into the BaltiCrypto wallet and are switched to Ethereum for our customers. We call this concept "SMART Managed Cryptomining".
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Our SMART and Decentralised Application (DApp) will allow token holders/users to have 24/7 overview of the mining operations including market and coin value, mining capacity and individual earnings, different coins mined, rigs status, rewards, hashrate etc.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    BaltiCrypto mining will remain active as long as the operations are profitable. Of course, far from relying on mining as a sole source of revenue, BaltiCrypto is future-proofed thanks to active diversification, seeking opportunities to not only safeguard reward streams, but add value to the Ecoverse and the experience of all who contribute.
