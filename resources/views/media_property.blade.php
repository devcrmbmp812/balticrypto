                        </div>
                        <p>The Media Center will be the information hub of the BaltiCrypto Ecoverse, the one-stop shop for information about mining operations, trade volumes, market news, updates on upcoming ICO’s, as well as general financial and environmental news from around the globe.</p>
                        <p>As the ICO launches, things will move quickly, and it is vital that we have a centralised space from which to communicate with contributors, as well as with the media and larger information space.  A key component of this will be the BaltiCrypto Blog, which will discuss all of the latest news in the Crypto space from the technical to the latest hot items and internal Balticrypto Press releases. </p>
                        <p>The Media Centre will also incorporate the BaltiCrypto Forum, where users can connect with each other, discuss market and strategy matters, or simply connect and continue to build our sense of community.  Contributors can also use the Forum to connect with 24/7 customer support, for a range of technical and other concerns.</p>

                        </div>
                        <p>One of the ways we provide security for contributors, and increase the asset backing of the tokens, is through land and real estate acquisition.  BaltiCrypto will be buying and developing its own land as well as designing and constructing its SMART village including mining warehouses and renewable energy parks.</p>
                        <p>Having a team with unique skills and knowledge in engineering, architecture/design and sustainable building and construction, stemming from more than 30 years of experience in the industry, we are able to use available land up to twice as efficiently as standard farms.  </p>
                        <p>In this area also, our Estonian location is a real benefit.  Land in Estonia is highly undervalued, and opportunities abound to procure sites at very economical rates, and turn them into profitable, sustainable mining farms, achieving both increased rewards for contributors, but the added security of a SMART Hybrid Token, backed by real assets.</p>

                        </div>
                        <p>Unemployment has far-reaching and significant effects on communities, far beyond the immediate struggle for sufficient financial resources.  The disempowerment and disenfranchisement it causes, are often passed down generationally, creating cycles of poverty and violence.</p>
                        <p>History has shown that when people are empowered to provide for themselves, and particularly when women are given the resources needed to support their families, communities flourish, standards of living go up, and people can begin focusing on levels of existence that go beyond pure survival.  Education becomes possible, and from there real societal change.</p>
                        <p>We in BaltiCrypto have thought seriously about this issue, and are gearing up for a multi-pronged assault on the issue.  We believe this venture should, and will, have the ability to effect change for people from all walks of life, not just those with the means to invest.  The many cells of the BaltiCrypto Ecoverse will provide numerous jobs for people from a range of fields, and cultivate talent in order to increase the net wisdom of the community.  </p>
                        <p>In addition to this, a large focus of the SMART Impact Foundations will be addressing this and other issues in the world’s most underprivileged areas, focusing on community health and nutritional information, financial education, as well as providing seed money for people, particularly women, looking to start small enterprises in their communities.</p>
                        <p>It’s just another way BaltiCrypto is changing the way blockchain is changing the world.</p>
