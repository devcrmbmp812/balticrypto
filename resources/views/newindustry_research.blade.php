                        </div>
                        <p>In this area as much as any other, we see the real beauty of BaltiCrypto’s integrated, global solution.  Because it is in our commercial interest to reduce energy usage, find more efficient renewable energy sources, and optimise our resource usage, every advance in these areas means improved rewards for all contributors.  </p>
                        <p>It is this synergy of commercial aspiration and sustainability consciousness that will drive both technological innovation at the University, but the intelligent, focused application of these advances to both the environmental and commercial concerns of the mining farm, as well as BaltiCrypto’s other enterprises.</p>

                        </div>
                        <p>While trading of crypto-assets is booming, some investors are looking for options to trade in new instruments that are similar to traditional securities, notes and options.  There is as yet no established, sophisticated futures or options market for the crypto space.</p>
                        <p>BaltiCrypto seeks to develop a platform that can help diversify the Ecoverse via a range of flagship products, as well as establishing our reputation as pioneers and innovators in the cryptocurrency market.</p>
                        <p>An example of this would be the offer of highly price-competitive Crypto Currencies Accumulator & Decumulator contracts ranging from one week to a month. You can capture the upward or downward trends of Cryptocurrencies steadily through investing in a BaltiCrypto Crypto Currencies Accumulator or Decumulator instrument.</p>
                        <p>As with all elements of the Ecoverse, these instruments will be augmented by the increased financial intelligence of the contributors using them, as the University and other cells in the structure of the Ecoverse provide a steady stream of educated, informed investors.</p>
