                    <p>As blockchain technology inevitably emerges as the future of money and information transfer, the need for people the world over to familiarise themselves with this new paradigm will increase in lockstep.  For many, the seemingly complicated nature of something that is inherently digital and abstract may seem too much to grasp.  However, the risks of not doing so are far too great to ignore.  In the first instance, these people will miss the wave, the opportunity to get in at the ground floor and establish their presence in the crypto space, and reap the incredible rewards which are available.  In the long term, these people will only fall further behind, as their lack of familiarity in an entirely new monetary ecosystem sees them struggle to find their way.  Many will be surprised at the rapidity with which this takes place.</p>
                    <p>We at BaltiCrypto see our responsibility in carrying our contributors into this new era, as paramount.  Whilst our operations in mining, green energy, and diversified, evolved commercial interests will serve contributors through ongoing rewards, we believe it is through focused, practical guidance and instruction that we will truly help contributors find their place in the new system.</p>
                    <p>It is for this reason that the BaltiCrypto University forms a key hub in our Ecoverse.  Through online, certified courses, we will provide participants with the knowledge they need to not just survive the systematic upheaval of the biggest change to commerce in centuries, but to thrive, and provide for themselves and their loved ones in ways they never thought possible.</p>

                    <p>Students will be required to sit an examination at the end of each course, and will receive a BaltiCrypto University certificate upon completion, as well as the benefits that come with increased expertise in finance and blockchain technology.  All courses can be paid for with BCT, which users can acquire from BaltiCryptoÂ´s platform, or from a public exchange once we get listed.</p>
                    <p>Future planning is for a physical BaltiCrypto University, which will be powered by our SMART hybrid energy systems, and run on the same ethical, sustainable principles upon which we run the mining farm and offices.  The University will be fully accredited and offer courses in a wide range of fields.</p>
