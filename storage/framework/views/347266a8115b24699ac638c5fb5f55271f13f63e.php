                        <p>BaltiCrypto Ecoverse acts like a SMART village, the contributors its citizens, and each part of the whole contributing, and benefiting from the contribution of the other parts.  One way in which we can increase this sense of belonging, is through the establishment of the BaltiCrypto Exchange.</p>
                        <p>Initially, contributors will need to take their tokens out of the platform if they wish to place them on public exchanges and trade them.  This will result in reduced mining rewards as per BaltiCrypto’s reward distribution policy. In the near future, however, BaltiCrypto will launch its own public exchange platform, to both simplify trading for token holders, as well as allow them to list their tokens without having to remove them from the platform.</p>
